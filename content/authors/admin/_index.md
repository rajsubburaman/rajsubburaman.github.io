      PhD Thesis - Fall Prediction and Controlled Fall of Humanoids  
      Advisors: Dr. Nikos Tsagarakis and Dr. Jinoh Lee

      - Developed a human-inspired multi-sensor based fall prediction technique to predict the fall over of humanoids reliably on different terrains  
      - Proposed two novel controllers based on active energy control concepts: injection, shaping, and distribution to mitigate the damages sustained by a humanoid during its fall over  
      - The proposed controllers are online applicable and adaptable to any arbitrary disturbances    
      - Developed a planning and control algorithm to manipulate a large sliding door for the humanoid WALK-MAN to walk through safely for the EU FP7 project WALK-MAN.

      Thesis on _General Control Law for Multi-limbed Robots for Pushing Task_   Supervised by Prof. Gabriel Lopez.

      - Analyzed how humans perform the pushing task and synthesized a controller for imbibing similar techniques into multi-limbed robots.  
      - Given an environment and a pushing task to any multi-limbed robots, the synthesized controller generates control commands to adapt the robot's posture and contacts for achieving the desired task with minimum effort

My current research interests include multi-sensor fusion, state estimation for humanoids, whole-body motion planning and control for multi-limb robots, whole-body multi-contact object manipulation, system identification of rigid and compliant systems, dynamic nonprehensile manipulation, optimization, and machine learning techniques. My interests also extend to the modeling and simulation of mechanical systems, as well as the design, fabrication, and analysis of mechanical structures and end-effectors for industrial manipulators.
