My current research interests include multi-sensor fusion, state estimation for humanoids, whole-body motion planning and control for multi-limb robots, whole-body multi-contact object manipulation, system identification of rigid and compliant systems, dynamic nonprehensile manipulation, optimization, and machine learning techniques. My interests also extend to the modeling and simulation of mechanical systems, as well as the design, fabrication, and analysis of mechanical structures and end-effectors for industrial manipulators.
